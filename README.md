# BackyardCoachLibrary

A library of character and game data for fighting games, starting with Dizzy from Guilty Gear.

## About

This repository contains structured JSON data for characters, movesets, and archetypes for use in fighting game tools and applications. The goal is to create a "coach" or training companion application.

## Data Structure

The data is organized in JSON files. Here's a quick overview of what you'll find:

*   **Character Data:** Files like `Dizzy01.json` and `dizzy02.json` contain basic character information.
*   **Move Lists:** Files like `dizzy_specials.json` and `dizzy_overdrives.json` detail the properties of character moves.
*   **Archetypes:** `player_archetype.json` defines player styles or character types.

## How to Use

You can use this data in your own projects. The repository will soon include a Python script (`loader.py`) to demonstrate how to easily load and access this data.

# Welcome to the Guilty Gear Strive Knowledge Base

1. Purpose of This Repository
This repository is a collaborative project designed to create the most comprehensive, structured, and accurate database for Guilty Gear Strive. The goal is to build a centralized source of information covering everything from high-level game theory and universal mechanics to the most granular, frame-by-frame data for every character on the roster.

This knowledge base is intended for:

Players: Of all skill levels, from beginners learning the fundamentals to seasoned veterans seeking deep matchup knowledge.

Content Creators: To serve as a reliable source for guides, tutorials, and analysis.

AI Companions: To provide a structured, machine-readable dataset for learning, analysis, and discussion of game theory.

The repository is organized into two main sections:

/docs/: Contains human-readable guides, strategic breakdowns, and explanations in Markdown format.

/data/: Contains raw numerical data, such as frame data and move properties, in structured JSON format for efficient parsing.

2. The Philosophy of Guilty Gear Strive: Where Lore Meets Function
Guilty Gear Strive is a game defined by its high-speed, aggressive ecosystem and a "rock and roll" aesthetic that permeates its stunning visuals and bold camera effects. More than just a fighting game, it is a world where a character's narrative identity and gameplay mechanics are deeply intertwined.   

To truly understand a character, one must understand their story. A perfect example is Queen Dizzy, a half-Gear who is a reluctant wielder of immense power. Her lore as a "pacifist's heart commanding a battlefield" is not just flavor text; it is the blueprint for her entire design. Her most powerful abilities are intentionally designed with thematic flaws, such as the "Generosity Paradox," where using her signature Freeze mechanic immobilizes the opponent but also grants them significant defensive resources. This synthesis of lore and function is a core tenet of the game's design philosophy.   

3. The Core Pillars of Gameplay
While each character is unique, the flow of every match is governed by a set of powerful universal mechanics that reward aggression and creativity. A foundational understanding of these systems is critical.

The Roman Cancel System: The engine of creativity in Strive. This system allows players to spend meter to cancel their actions, creating opportunities for combo extensions, defensive escapes, and complex offensive pressure.   

Aggressive Offense: The game heavily incentivizes an offensive playstyle. Mechanics like the Wall Break provide a "Positive Bonus"—granting rapid resource regeneration—to the player who successfully corners and overwhelms their opponent.   

The R.I.S.C. Gauge: Blocking is not a purely defensive action. Forcing an opponent to block a series of attacks builds their R.I.S.C. Gauge. When full, the next hit they take becomes a massive counter-hit, turning a minor poke into a devastating, round-winning opportunity.   

4. How to Use This Repository
To get started, it is highly recommended to read the documents in the /docs/game-systems/ folder in order. They are designed to build upon one another, starting with the absolute basics and moving toward more advanced concepts.

For Game Rules: Begin with 01_gameplay_fundamentals.md to learn the language and basic actions of the game.

For Character Guides: Navigate to /docs/characters/ to find detailed overviews and matchup strategies for specific characters.

For Raw Data: If you need specific numbers (frame data, damage, etc.), the JSON files in the /data/characters/ directory are your primary source.

This knowledge base is a living project. We will continue to populate it with data for every character and keep it updated with every patch. Let's rock!`

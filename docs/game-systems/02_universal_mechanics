`# Guilty Gear Strive: Universal Mechanics

This document details the complex systems and resource gauges that define high-level play in Guilty Gear Strive. It builds upon the concepts introduced in 01_gameplay_fundamentals.md.

Section 1: The Roman Cancel System
The Roman Cancel (RC) is the central, most flexible mechanic in Strive, allowing players to spend 50% of their Tension Gauge to manipulate time and create new offensive or defensive opportunities.

Red Roman Cancel (RRC): Performed while an attack is connecting with the opponent. It launches the opponent, allowing for combo extensions that would otherwise be impossible.

Blue Roman Cancel (BRC): Performed while in a neutral state (not attacking or blocking). It slows down the opponent, enabling complex movement, mix-ups, or a safe way to close distance.

Purple Roman Cancel (PRC): Performed during the recovery frames of an attack that has whiffed. It cancels the recovery animation, making an otherwise punishable move safe or allowing for a quick follow-up.

Yellow Roman Cancel (YRC): Performed while in blockstun. It creates a shockwave that pushes the opponent back, serving as a powerful, meter-based defensive tool to escape pressure.    

Section 2: Resource Gauges
Tension Gauge
The Tension Gauge is filled by moving forward and performing offensive actions. It is the primary resource for powerful maneuvers.

Usage: 50% is required for Roman Cancels and most Overdrives. Some Overdrives, like Dizzy's Gamma Ray, can consume up to 100%.    

Burst Gauge
The Burst Gauge is the circular meter under the health bar that fills as you take damage or block attacks.

Usage:

Psych Burst (Blue/Gold): Consumes 100% of the gauge. A Blue Burst pushes the opponent away when used while being hit, acting as a primary combo breaker. A Gold Burst can be used in a neutral state to instantly fill your Tension Gauge.

Wild Assault: Consumes 50% of the gauge for an offensive lunge.

Deflect Shield: Consumes 50% of the gauge for a defensive pushback.

R.I.S.C. Gauge
Located directly below the health bar, the R.I.S.C. Gauge builds as a character blocks attacks.

Function: When the gauge is filled, the character will flash white. The next hit they take will be a massive Counter Hit, leading to significantly higher damage.

Strategic Importance: This makes applying pressure, even if blocked, a viable strategy to "prime" the opponent for a decisive punish.    

Patch 1.48 Change: The R.I.S.C. Gauge now accumulates more gradually, reducing instances of sudden, extreme damage.    

Section 3: Advanced Defensive Mechanics
Blocking
Faultless Defense (FD): Performed by blocking while holding any two attack buttons (except Dust). It consumes Tension Gauge to increase pushback on blocked attacks, creating space to escape pressure. It also negates chip damage and R.I.S.C. gain.    

Instant Block (IB): Blocking just before an attack connects. It reduces blockstun and grants more Tension, allowing you to punish moves that would normally be safe.

Wall Break and Positive Bonus
Applying continuous pressure in the corner will cause the opponent to stick to the wall. Further attacks will trigger a "Wall Break," a cinematic sequence that deals extra damage and transitions to a new part of the stage.

Positive Bonus: The player who initiates the Wall Break is granted a "Positive Bonus," which provides rapid Tension Gauge regeneration for a limited time, making corner pressure a primary strategic objective. `

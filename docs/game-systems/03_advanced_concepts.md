Guilty Gear Strive: Advanced Concepts
This document details the more nuanced systems in Guilty Gear Strive that govern damage, stun, and character-specific states. A mastery of these concepts is essential for optimizing combos, pressure, and punishment.

Part 1: Attack Level
Every strike in the game is assigned an Attack Level, typically from 0 to 4. This value is a crucial piece of frame data that determines several key properties of an attack when it connects with an opponent.

Function: Attack Level dictates the duration of hitstun, blockstun, and hitstop.

Higher Level = More Stun: A higher Attack Level generally results in longer stun animations for the opponent, creating more frame advantage for the attacker. For example, a Level 4 attack will lock an opponent in blockstun for much longer than a Level 0 attack, making it better for pressure.

Strategic Importance: Knowing a move's Attack Level is key to understanding blockstring gaps and combo theory. It explains why some moves feel "heavier" and are better for frame traps, while others are quick but grant less advantage.

Part 2: Counter Hits (CH)
A Counter Hit (CH) occurs when you successfully strike an opponent during the startup or active frames of their own attack. Counter Hits are a powerful reward for successful reads and are a cornerstone of high-level offense.

Standard Effect: A normal Counter Hit causes the opponent to take 10% more damage and suffer increased hitstun, often opening up combo routes that would not be possible on a normal hit.

R.I.S.C. Counter Hit: This is the most powerful type of Counter Hit. It occurs when you strike an opponent whose R.I.S.C. Gauge is full. It deals an additional 10% damage on top of the standard CH bonus and triggers the strongest possible hitstun state, leading to massive, round-winning combos.

Counter Hit Types: The game further classifies Counter Hits into different types (e.g., Small, Mid, Large), which determine the specific animation and properties of the resulting stun (e.g., a long stagger, a high wall bounce, or a spinning knockdown). Dizzy's 5H, for example, can lead to an optimal conversion if the first hit lands as a Counter Hit, allowing it to be canceled into a full combo before the move's heavy scaling is applied. Â

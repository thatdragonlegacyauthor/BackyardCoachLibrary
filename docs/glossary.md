Glossary: Frame Data and Hitbox Concepts
This document defines the core technical terms used to describe the properties of moves in Guilty Gear Strive. A deep understanding of these concepts is essential for analyzing character matchups, developing combos, and making informed decisions during a match.

Part 1: Frame Data Fundamentals
Frame
The single, indivisible unit of time in a fighting game. Guilty Gear Strive runs at 60 Frames Per Second (FPS), meaning one frame is equal to 1/60th of a second. All move properties—speed, duration, and advantage—are measured in frames.

The Three Phases of an Attack
Every attack in the game is broken down into three distinct phases, measured in frames.

Startup Frames: The period of time from when you press an attack button until the move can actually hit the opponent. A move with fewer startup frames is faster. During startup, the move has no hitbox and cannot damage the opponent.

Active Frames: The period of time when the move's hitbox is present and can connect with an opponent. A move with more active frames is easier to time as a "meaty" attack on an opponent's wakeup.

Recovery Frames: The period of time after the active frames have ended, during which your character is returning to a neutral state and cannot perform any other action (unless the move is canceled). A move with more recovery frames is "less safe" and leaves you vulnerable for longer if it whiffs or is blocked.
